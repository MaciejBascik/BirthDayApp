# React + Vite + tailwind

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
  
# Birthday App in React + vite + tailwind

A simple react app showing who is celebrating birthday today. You can add new people to list. Be careful with date, because it shows only today's birthdays. Correct date format is 'month-day'. For example: 11-29 is correct.
